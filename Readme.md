 In the context of Extent Reports, the difference between a base64 screenshot and a normal screenshot lies in how the screenshots are captured and displayed in the report.

1. **Normal Screenshot**:
   - A normal screenshot is taken using traditional methods, where the screenshot of the webpage or application is captured and saved as an image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) on the filesystem of the machine where the test is running.
   - The path or URL of the saved screenshot file is then provided to Extent Reports, and the report includes a reference or link to the external image file for embedding/displaying the screenshot in the report.
   - Normal screenshots are stored as separate files on the file system, and they can be easily accessed and managed outside the Extent Report as regular image files.

2. **Base64 Screenshot**:
   - A base64 screenshot, on the other hand, involves converting the screenshot image into a base64 encoded string representation directly in memory.
   - Instead of saving the screenshot as a file on the file system, the image data is converted to a base64 string, which can then be directly embedded into the HTML report without relying on external files.
   - Base64 encoded images are embedded directly into the HTML report, making it self-contained and eliminating the need to manage and refer to external image files.
   - While the image data is stored within the HTML report, this can also lead to larger report sizes if multiple base64 images are included.

  The main difference is in how the screenshot data is handled and presented in the Extent Reports:
- Normal screenshots are stored as external files and referenced in the report, while base64 screenshots are embedded directly into the HTML report as encoded strings.
- Base64 screenshots provide a self-contained report with embedded images but might increase the report size due to the encoded image data, whereas normal screenshots rely on external image files.
